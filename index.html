                <p>One day, I decided to follow my dog, Roxy, into the woods.</p>
                <p>She loves going into the woods and usually I yell at her not to. But that day, I decided to <em>follow</em> after her instead of <em>holler</em> after her.</p>
            </div>
            <div id ="prep">
                <p>It was a brisk, cold afternoon near the end of November.</p> 
                <p>I was bundled up in my fleece-lined leggings, sweatshirt, coat, and another large flannel coat over that one. Can't forget gloves and a warm headband, too.</p>

            <div id ="fleeting">
                <p>I had the fleeting thought to text my husband and let him know. Just in case I fell or went missing.</p>
                <p class ="text-paragraph"><strong>Nov 23, 2020 approx. 12:00pm: </strong><em>I went into the woods with Roxy fyi.</em></p>
            </div>
            <div id="meander">
                <p>As we meandered, leaves rustling around our feet and paws, we began down a sloping hill into the ravine. I was careful where I stepped and held onto tiny trees for support. Roxy rushed forward excitedly.</p>
            </div>
            <div id ="sitting">
                <p>I very soon came across a fallen tree that made for a perfect place to sit.</p>
                <p>I started singing "Sitting on a log in the woods" to the tune of "Sitting on the dock of the bay".</p>
            </div>
            <img id="log" src="images/log.jpg" alt="Fallen tree perfect for sitting." width="300" height="400">
            <div id ="gorgeous">
                <p>I looked around as Roxy explored her surroundings. The sky was a gorgeous blue and practically cloudless. The sun shone high and bright, rays filtered through the naked branches. I sent another text to my husband.</p>
                <p class ="text-paragraph"><strong>Nov 23, 2020, approx. 12:05pm: </strong><em>It's nice out here lol. Roxy is staying close and just sniffing and roaming.</em></p>
            </div>
            <img id="sunrays" src="images/sunrays.jpg" alt="Sunshine through naked tree branches." width="300" height="500">
            <div id ="majestic">
                <p>Roxy came over after sniffing every rock and leaf and stick to her satisfaction and decided to sit as well.</p>
                <p>She's majestic.</p>
            </div>
            <img id="doggo" src="images/pup_majestic.jpg" alt="Majestic doggo in the sun." width="300" height="400">
            <div id="fin">
                <p>After around 20 minutes and some more meandering, we decided to head back to the house.</p>
                <p>Following my dog into the woods was probably the best decision I've made for my mental health all year.</p>
